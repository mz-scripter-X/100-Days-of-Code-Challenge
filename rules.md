# Rules of the 100 Days of Code Challenge
## Main Commitment
### _I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days._
**Start Date**
## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress everyday -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that won't count towards the challenge
   > But I dont work since I'm a student
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources wil NOT count towards this challenge.
